# Cybersecurity Dashboard App 

This is an ongoing project focused on building a **Cybersecurity Dashboard** using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS** for frontend development. The application integrates **Firebase (Firestore & Auth)** for authentication and database services, and **AWS Lambda** and **AWS S3** for password backup functionality. 

## üöß Project Status: In Development

Currently, the **main dashboard page** is complete, and the remaining features are actively under development. Future features include a **Password Generator**, **User Authentication**, **Profile Manipulation**, and **Settings**. The dashboard will also provide insights into password health, such as detecting breached, weak, reused, and expired passwords.

##  Features (Completed & Upcoming)

### Completed:
- **Dashboard Layout**: A responsive and dynamic user interface for the cybersecurity dashboard, built with React.js and styled using Tailwind CSS.
- **Firebase Integration**: Firebase has been integrated into the project, with Firestore planned for storing user-generated passwords, and Firebase Authentication to manage users.

### Upcoming Features:
- **Password Generator**: Users will be able to generate strong, random passwords directly from the dashboard.
- **Password Health Analysis**: 
  - **Breached Passwords**: Detection of passwords found in data breaches.
  - **Weak Passwords**: Identifying passwords that are easy to crack or don't meet complexity requirements.
  - **Reused Passwords**: Alerting users to passwords that are reused across different accounts.
  - **Expired Passwords**: Notifying users about passwords that haven't been rotated or changed in a while.
- **User Authentication**: Full Firebase Authentication integration (with email and social logins) is planned.
- **Profile Manipulation**: Users will be able to edit their profiles, manage passwords, and customize their settings.
- **Password Backup to AWS S3**: Users will be able to back up their generated passwords to AWS S3, with secure password encryption using AWS Lambda.
- **Settings Page**: Options for password complexity, security preferences, and notification settings.

## üìã Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run the project locally on your machine:

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system.
- **Firebase Account**: You need a Firebase account and project set up.
- **AWS Account**: Set up an AWS account for Lambda and S3 integrations.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ramankhanal7/cybersecurity-dashboard.git
   cd cybersecurity-dashboard
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
4. **Setup Firebase**:
   Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables with your Firebase credentials:
   ```
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
